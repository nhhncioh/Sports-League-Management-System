- Git for cloning the repository

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-league-management.git
   cd sports-league-management
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables:
   ```sh
   # The setup script will automatically create .env from .env.example if it doesn't exist
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file and set your environment variables:
   - `POSTGRES_USER`: Database username
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password
   - `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
   - `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY`: Your API token from football-data.org
   - Other configuration variables as needed

3. Run the setup script:

   ```
   This will:
   - Check if Docker is running
   - Create necessary environment files
   - Build and start the Docker containers

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)
