## Features
- Real-time data integration
- Management of teams, players, coaches, referees, matches, scores, and standings
- User-friendly interface for administrators and users
- Detailed search and filtering options
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Modular design for easy maintenance and scalability

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask (Python framework)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Other Libraries:** Requests, Gunicorn, Psycopg2, Python-Dotenv, Werkzeug

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git for cloning the repository

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-league-management.git
   cd sports-league-management
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables:
   ```sh
   # The setup script will automatically create .env from .env.example if it doesn't exist
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file and set your environment variables:
   - `POSTGRES_USER`: Database username
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password
   - `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
   - `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY`: Your API token from football-data.org
   - Other configuration variables as needed

3. Run the setup script:
   ```sh
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Check if Docker is running
   - Create necessary environment files
   - Build and start the Docker containers

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

Multi-tenant note (local development):
- Create a demo org:
  - `flask org:create --name "Demo League" --slug demo --admin-email admin@demo.com --admin-password password123`
  - `flask seed:demo --org demo`
- Access options:
  - http://demo.localhost:5000 (if subdomains of localhost work on your OS)
  - http://localhost:5000/?org=demo (works everywhere)
  - Or set `DEFAULT_ORG_SLUG=demo` in `.env` and just visit http://localhost:5000

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)
If you prefer to run the application without Docker:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```sh
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```
   
   Or using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL database and run the schema:
   ```sh
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -a -f schema.sql
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

Features of the dataset:
- Complete statistics for top 5 European leagues
- Weekly automated updates
- Available in both CSV and SQLite formats

## Database Schema
The database schema is designed to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity by using foreign keys and transactions. The main entities include users, stadiums, leagues, seasons, teams, coaches, players, matches, scores, scorers, standings, referees, and match referees.

## ER Diagram
The ER diagram illustrates the relationships between different entities in the Sports League Management System. Each table represents an entity, and the lines between them represent relationships. Primary keys are indicated by the underlined attributes, and foreign keys are shown as arrows pointing to the related primary keys.
