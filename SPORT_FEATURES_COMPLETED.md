Created comprehensive configuration system defining for each sport:
- **Player statistics** with labels and abbreviations
- **Team statistics**
- **Game events**
- **Scoring type** (goals, points, runs, etc.)
- **Standings point systems**
- **Draw allowance** (some sports don't allow draws)

**Sports Included**:
1. Soccer/Football - Goals, Assists, Shots, Passes, Saves
2. Basketball - Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, FG%, 3P%
3. Hockey - Goals, Assists, Plus/Minus, Saves, Penalty Minutes

9. Other - Generic stats

**Helper Functions Available**:
```python
from slms.services.sport_config import (
    get_sport_config,
    get_player_stats_for_sport,
    get_standings_points_config,
    allows_draws,
    get_sport_display_name
)
```

### 3. **League Management UI** ✅
**File**: `slms/templates/manage_leagues.html`
- Added sport dropdown selector (9 options)
- Shows help text explaining sport determines available statistics
- JavaScript updated to handle sport in edit mode

**File**: `slms/blueprints/admin/routes.py` - `manage_leagues()` route
- Saves sport field when creating/editing leagues
- Loads sport field when displaying leagues

### 4. **Player Stats Page Enhancements** ✅
**File**: `slms/templates/player_stats.html`
- Added sport indicator that shows when filtering by league
- Displays: "Sport: Basketball | Primary Stats: Points, Rebounds, Assists..."
- Updated league dropdown to include sport data attributes
- Added sport-aware help text in "Add Player Stats" modal
- Shows sport-specific stat badges (e.g., "Points (PTS)", "Rebounds (REB)")
- Dynamically changes "Goals" label to "Points" for basketball, "Runs" for baseball, etc.

**File**: `slms/blueprints/admin/routes.py` - `player_stats()` route

- Loads sport-specific points config
- Falls back to sport defaults if no custom league rules exist

**Point Systems by Sport**:
- **Soccer**: Win=3pts, Draw=1pt, Loss=0pts
- **Basketball**: Win=2pts, Loss=0pts (no draws)
- **Hockey**: Win=2pts, OT Loss=1pt, Loss=0pts

## 📊 How It Works

### League Creation Flow
1. Admin goes to Manage Leagues
2. Fills in league name, country, colors, etc.
3. **Selects sport** from dropdown (e.g., "Basketball")
4. Sport is saved to database
5. All future features reference this sport setting

### Player Stats Flow
1. Admin goes to Player Stats page
2. Filters by league (e.g., "NBA League")
3. **Sport indicator appears**: "Sport: Basketball | Primary Stats: Points, Rebounds, Assists..."
4. Clicks "Add Player Stats"
5. Selects the basketball league
6. **Modal updates**: Shows basketball stats, changes "Goals" → "Points"
7. Enters stats and saves

### Standings Calculation Flow
1. Admin clicks "Recalculate Standings"
2. Selects league and season
3. System checks league's sport (e.g., Basketball)
4. **Applies basketball point system**: Win=2pts, Loss=0pts (no draws)
5. Calculates standings accordingly
6. Saves results

## 🎯 What This Enables

### Current Capabilities
- ✅ Each league can have its own sport
- ✅ Sport configuration system knows what stats are relevant for each sport
- ✅ Player stats page shows sport-appropriate indicators
- ✅ Standings use sport-specific point systems
- ✅ UI adapts terminology (Goals → Points for basketball)
- ✅ Help text guides users on what stats to track

### Example Use Cases
1. **Multi-Sport Organization**: Run a soccer league, basketball league, and volleyball league all in one system with appropriate stats for each
2. **International vs Domestic**: Have one league using international soccer rules (3pts for win) and another using different scoring
3. **Youth vs Adult**: Different sports for different age groups
4. **Tournament Formats**: Use rugby's bonus point system for tournaments

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Code Examples

#### Get Sport Configuration
```python
# In a route
from slms.services.sport_config import get_sport_config

sport = 'basketball'
config = get_sport_config(sport)
player_stats = config['player_stats']
# [
#   {'key': 'points', 'label': 'Points', 'abbr': 'PTS', ...},
#   {'key': 'rebounds', 'label': 'Rebounds', 'abbr': 'REB', ...},
#   ...
# ]
```

#### Check if Draws Allowed
```python
from slms.services.sport_config import allows_draws

if allows_draws('basketball'):
    # False - basketball doesn't allow draws
    pass
else:
    # Force winner selection in UI
    pass
```

#### Get Standings Points
```python
from slms.services.sport_config import get_standings_points_config

points = get_standings_points_config('rugby')
# {'win': 4, 'draw': 2, 'loss': 0, 'bonus_try': 1, 'bonus_losing': 1}

team_points = wins * points['win'] + draws * points.get('draw', 0)
```

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Get league with sport
SELECT league_id, name, sport FROM leagues WHERE league_id = ?;

-- Filter leagues by sport
SELECT * FROM leagues WHERE sport = 'basketball';

-- Join to get sport for a season
SELECT s.*, l.sport
FROM seasons s
JOIN leagues l ON s.league_id = l.league_id
WHERE s.season_id = ?;
```

### JavaScript Usage

```javascript
// Available in player_stats.html
const sportConfigs = {{ sport_configs|tojson }};
const leagues = {{ leagues|tojson }};

// Get config for a league
const league = leagues.find(l => l.id == leagueId);
const config = sportConfigs[leagueId];

// Access player stats
config.player_stats.forEach(stat => {
    console.log(`${stat.label} (${stat.abbr})`);
});
```

## 📋 What's NOT Yet Implemented

### 1. **Full Score Entry Integration**
The `score_game.html` template exists but hasn't been updated to show sport-specific stat entry fields. Currently it just tracks final scores.

**Future Enhancement**: When scoring a basketball game, show fields for Points, Rebounds, Assists per player. For soccer, show Goals, Assists, Cards, etc.

### 2. **Public-Facing Displays**
Public pages (player profiles, team pages, leaderboards) still use generic terminology.

**Future Enhancement**: Show "PPG" for basketball leagues, "Goals" for soccer leagues on public stat displays.

### 3. **Advanced Stats per Sport**
The `scorer_metrics` table has `custom_metrics` JSON field that's perfect for sport-specific stats, but the UI doesn't dynamically generate forms for all stat types yet.

**Future Enhancement**: Use sport config to generate dynamic form fields for all stats defined for that sport.

### 4. **Sport-Specific Validation**
No validation yet that certain stats are only valid for certain sports (e.g., prevents entering "Rebounds" for a soccer player).

**Future Enhancement**: Add validation based on sport config.

2. Open Filters
3. Select a league from dropdown
4. **Verify**: Sport indicator appears showing the league's sport
5. Click "Add Player Stats"
6. Select the same league
7. **Verify**: Help text appears showing sport-specific stats
8. **Verify**: If basketball league, "Goals" label changes to "Points"

### Test Standings Calculation
1. Create two leagues: one Soccer, one Basketball
2. Add teams and matches to each
3. Go to Recalculate Standings
4. Calculate for soccer league
   - **Verify**: Wins = 3 points

   - **Verify**: Wins = 2 points

### Test Sport Configurations
```python
# In Python shell or route
from slms.services.sport_config import get_all_sports, get_sport_config

# List all sports
sports = get_all_sports()
for sport in sports:
    print(f"{sport['key']}: {sport['display_name']}")

# Get basketball config
config = get_sport_config('basketball')
print(config['player_stats'])  # Should show Points, Rebounds, etc.
print(config['allows_draws'])  # Should be False
```
