## Conflict Types

### 1. Blackout Date Violation

**Auto-resolvable**: Yes
**Description**: Match scheduled during a blackout period
**Resolution**: Automatically moves match to next available date

### 2. Double Booking
**Severity**: Error
**Auto-resolvable**: No
**Description**: Team has multiple matches on same day
**Resolution**: Manual rescheduling required

### 3. Rest Period Violation
**Severity**: Warning
**Auto-resolvable**: Yes
**Description**: Less than 2 days between matches for same team
**Resolution**: Automatically adjusts match dates to ensure minimum rest

### 4. Venue Conflict
**Severity**: Error
**Auto-resolvable**: No
**Description**: Venue booked for multiple matches within 4 hours
**Resolution**: Change venue or adjust timing manually

## Best Practices

1. **Create Multiple Plans**: Test different scheduling options
2. **Set Blackout Dates Early**: Define holidays, international breaks before generating schedules
3. **Review Conflicts**: Always check and resolve conflicts before submitting for approval
4. **Use Meaningful Names**: Name plans descriptively (e.g., "2024 Spring Season - Option A")
5. **Export Regularly**: Backup schedules by exporting to multiple formats
6. **Test Publish on Copy**: Create a copy of approved plan before publishing to production

## Workflow Example

### Typical Season Setup

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define blackout dates (holidays, international breaks)
   - Create 2-3 plan options with different parameters

2. **Review Phase**
   - Review each plan for conflicts
   - Use drag-and-drop to optimize match order
   - Get stakeholder feedback

3. **Selection Phase**
   - Choose best plan
   - Submit for official approval

4. **Approval Phase**
   - League officials review and approve
   - Make final adjustments if needed

5. **Publication**
   - Publish approved schedule
   - Export to various formats for distribution
   - Share with teams, venues, and media

## Technical Details

### Generation Algorithm

The system uses a **round-robin algorithm** to ensure fair scheduling:

1. Each team plays every other team once (or twice for double round-robin)
2. Teams are rotated while keeping one team fixed (circle method)
3. Blackout dates are automatically skipped
4. Matches are distributed at specified intervals

### Conflict Detection

Runs automatically after:
- Plan creation
- Manual reordering
- Import operations

Checks performed:
- Database queries for overlapping schedules
- Date range validations
- Team availability checks
- Venue capacity and booking checks

### Performance Optimizations

- Indexed database tables for fast queries
- Batch operations for bulk imports
- Lazy loading for large plan lists
- Caching of conflict detection results

## Troubleshooting

### Plan Not Generating

**Problem**: "At least 2 teams required" error
**Solution**: Ensure league has at least 2 teams created

### Conflicts Not Resolving

**Problem**: Auto-resolve not working
**Solution**: Some conflicts require manual intervention (e.g., venue conflicts)

### Import Failing

**Problem**: File import errors
**Solution**: Download and use the provided templates, ensure correct format

### Published Matches Not Appearing

**Problem**: Plan published but no matches visible
**Solution**: Check that plan was in "approved" status before publishing
