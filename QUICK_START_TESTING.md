### "No module named..." error
- Restart containers: `docker-compose restart web worker`
- Check the logs: `docker-compose logs web`

### Registration form doesn't show
- Make sure the season has `registration_open = True`
- Check that a waiver exists and is active
- Verify the season has a `registration_mode` set

### Can't access /admin/registrations
- Make sure you're logged in as an admin
- Check your user role (should be ADMIN or OWNER)

### File upload doesn't work
- Check that `slms/static/uploads/team_logos/` folder exists
- Check that `slms/static/uploads/player_photos/` folder exists
- File size limit is 5MB

### Email not sending
- Emails are queued for sending by a background worker
- Check worker logs: `docker-compose logs worker`
- Email configuration needs to be set in environment variables

## 📊 What to Look For

✅ Emergency contacts
✅ Medical information (if provided)
✅ Uploaded files (logos/photos)

### Actions That Should Work:
✅ Approve → sends email, updates status

✅ Waitlist → updates status, sends email
✅ Mark Paid → records payment details, sends email
✅ Add Note → timestamps and attributes to admin
✅ Delete → removes registration and uploaded files
